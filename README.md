# RoundAboutArcade
 Round about arcade game created during a 4 hour flight

Currently still having issues getting the game to continue spinning after a
failed attempt in terminal; works in BlueJ IDE. --Currently fixed with a weird use of print statements, need to look into the thread of it further to fix differently.
